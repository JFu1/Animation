# Animation

Welcome to **Animation**, an environent for authoring [Processing](https://processing.org)-style animations with Swift.

## Motivation

Animation shares the same goal as the Processing environment – to allow students to learn programming by creating interactive graphics.

The following is an excerpt from **Getting Started with Processing** (2010) by Casey Reas and Ben Fry:

*Programming courses typically focus on structure and theory first. Anything visual—an interface, an animation—is considered a dessert to be enjoyed only after finishing your vegetables, usually several weeks of studying algorithms and methods. Over the years, we’ve watched many friends try to take such courses and drop out after the first lecture or after a long, frustrating night before the first assignment deadline. What initial curiosity they had about making the computer work for them was lost because they couldn’t see a path from what they had to learn first to what they wanted to create.*

My experience has been that:

* easy creation of interative graphics
* the elegance of the Swift programming language
* the forgiving and exploratory nature of the Swift Playgrounds environment

... combines to make an extremely powerful introductory learning experience for students in Computer Science classes.
